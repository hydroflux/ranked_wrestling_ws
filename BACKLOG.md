# BACKLOG

## General To Do

- [ ] Add timers
- [ ] Consider refactoring 'count_leagues' and 'count_teams' into unified 'count' functions--very similar series of functions ('get_number...', 'report...', 'count...')
- [ ] 'get_league_links' and 'get_team_links' are, as above, almost identical functions
- [ ] 'add_teams' and 'add_leagues' are identical other than a frame switch

## Classes & Objects

- [ ] Do a gap analysis of the "Stats" class vs. the 'stats' object to determine the best way to proceed
- [ ] Benefits of using "Stats" class: Hold ids, class_names, and tag_names in the class instance

## Interface

- [ ] Create a way to prompt the user for 'season', 'headless', and 'state', etc.

## Selenium Utilities

### Locators

- [ ] Implement a 'quick' option to skip the WebDriverWait to locator functions
